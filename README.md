Obtaining quality microalgae datasets in terms of high quality and diversity has created a significant challenge in the artificial intelligence (AI) microalgae domain. To date, the implementation of Generative AI in the image generation space has been widely explored in the medical and biological sectors. However, this approach has not been exploited in the field of microalgae biotechnology. This present research assessed various generative models such as Fast Generative Adversarial Network (FastGAN), Gated Pixel Convolutional Neural Network prior with Vector Quantised - Variational Auto Encoder (G-PixelCNN-VQVAE), and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) to generate synthetic images that can capture various features of different microalgae species including Chlorella vulgaris FSP-E (C.V), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C.R) and Spirulina platensis (S.P). Our results showed the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 32.55, 96.44 and 147.24, respectively for the conditional FastGAN, G-PixelCNN-VQVAE and DDIM. The downstream image classification task showed that training with 100% synthetic data derived from the conditional FastGAN achieved the highest validation score of 78.58%, as compared to 99.66% with the original dataset. However, when trained on the G-PixelCNN with conditional VQVAE and combined dataset, we achieved the highest validation score of 99.80%, indicating a subtle boost in performance.
